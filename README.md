# mtb-template-cat2

## Overview

mtb-template-cat2 provides BSP template files for the BSP Assistant tool. mtb-template-cat2 contains files for the following devices:

* PSoC 4
* PMG1

## BSP Configuration

The BSP has a few hooks that allow its behavior to be configured. Some of these items are enabled by default while others must be explicitly enabled. Items enabled by default are specified in the {{ name }}.mk file. The items that are enabled can be changed by creating a custom BSP or by editing the application makefile.

Defines:
* CY_USING_HAL - This define, enabled by default, specifies that the HAL is intended to be used by the application. This will cause the BSP to include the applicable header file and to initialize the system level drivers.
* CYBSP_CUSTOM_SYSCLK_PM_CALLBACK - This define, disabled by default, causes the BSP to skip registering its default SysClk Power Management callback, if any, and instead to invoke the application-defined function `cybsp_register_custom_sysclk_pm_callback` to register an application-specific callback.
